## How to submit feedback?

The best way to send feedback is to [file an issue](https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.git_org_name }}/{{ cookiecutter.git_repo_name }}/issues).

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :).
